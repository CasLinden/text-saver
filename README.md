# Text Saver

Text saver is an app that lets you quickly save text and access it later. It's lighter and a bit faster than google docs, trading off some utility. It uses a mix of server and client side rendering using EJS view templates and ES6 modules.

## Technologies used:

- Node.js with Express and Mongoose 
- MongoDB
- EJS view templates server side
- ES6 modules on the client side
- CSS
